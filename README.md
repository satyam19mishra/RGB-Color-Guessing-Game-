# RGB-Color-Guessing-Game-
Its a color predicting game in which you have to predict the colors resulting from the combination of primary colors.
Its a color guessing game based on the fact that every color is a combination of three primary color red,green and blue. I have used JavaScript ,Html and CSS for this project. This game aims to develop the color predicting ability of a person as the game generates random color each time and also adds  curiosity to an individual to find the possible color formed due to random combination of primary color.
